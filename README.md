# password-generator

## Description

I want to randomly generate a password that meets specific criteria to create a strong password that provides greater security using javascript. The project aims to create a password that randomly meets particular criteria. That will make a strong password that offers excellent protection. The project's goal is to pick passwords with lengths from 8 characters to 128 and is randomized with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols and will generate a strong passcode for you, and you can make as many as you want. If can go to the project here https://github.com/Sydneychick2748/password-generator. There are many ways to go about this in JavaScript. When working with some of the class, everyone had different codes and how they went about the task asked. I was unsure how to begin because I had a starter code that I did not completely understand, and I did a lot of research. I saw a lot of password generator examples and liked a particular one that did not use an array at the beginning. They used an object instead, so I tried to use an object I almost gave up on because I could not get the code to work. But I finally did and was happy that I did not have to give up my object, which I was pleased with. I felt like it was easier for me to understand personally rather than the array method.

## Installation

 To set up the development environment  and get it running I made a copy of the  file that was given int the vs code. I made a folder in my finder and named it. Then went to  GitHub and  created a new repository using the same name that I named my folder. Then I copied the link from the new repository to the terminal, made the folder in the vs. code, and then pasted the copied code from the first step into the new folder in the vs. code. Then went back to GitHub, copied the ssh key, and made a clone. The contents included:
Index.html
Syles.css
Scripts.js


## Usage



When taken to the page, there will be a button to generate a password, and when you click the button, a prompt box will show up asking for the length of the password, and it should be at least eight characters and no more than 128 characters.

If the password does not meet the criteria above, there will be an alert telling the user to pick the number between the above criteria of at least eight characters and no more than 128 characters.

Then you will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria, and then you will select which criteria you would like to include in the password.

When you are asked for lowercase letters to include in the password, you can click the "ok" button, or if you do want any lowercase letters in your password, click the "cancel" button.

When all prompts are answered, a prompt will tell you that you have successfully created a strong password.

## Features.
Some of the features of my assignment is obtaining a randomized password that the computer will generate for the user. It will only let you pick between 8 and 128 character types and generate the random string for the user at the end .it will also let you pick which characters you want in your password. 
The extra feature  I added was the reset button. When you click on the rest button ,  it will refresh the box and you can start again by clicking on Generate  password button
